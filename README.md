# python-challenge

## General:
This challenge had two parts, PyBank and PyPoll. The purpose and outcome of each is outlined below:

### PyBank:
In this challenge, we were provided a CSV file showing profit/loss by date. We were instructed to calculate the following:
  1. Total number of months
  2. Net total of Profit/Losses over the entire period (entire period assumed to mean the entire dataset)
  3. Changes in P/L over the entire period and the average of those changes
  4. Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  5. Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script of the analysis results was to print to the terminal and export to a text file with the file name "analysis". My code was successful in achieving both of these final steps for each part of the analysis outline above. 

### PyPoll:
In this challenge, we were provided a CSV file with data for an election. The dataset included voter id, county, and candidate. We were instructed to create a script to analyze votes by calculating the following:
  1. Total number of votes cast
  2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
  3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
  4. The total number of votes each candidate won
  5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

The final script of the analysis was to print to the terminal and export to a text file with the file name "analysis". My code was successful in printing to the terminal each part of the analysis outline above. However, unfortunately, after much trial and error, I was unable to figure out how to get line 56 of my code (candidate name with % and vote count) to successfully print to the text file before the deadline of this assignment.
